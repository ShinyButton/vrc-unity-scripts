Partly vibe-coded editor script to place `VRCRotationConstraint`s in GameObjects. Inspired by Toribase's `ToriConstraints.cs`; the included constraints work for Toribase (but based on the Blender file not the Unity example). This one creates modern VRC constraints not plain Unity rotation constraints.

I got tired of re-creating these every time I did something to mess up the model ðŸ™ƒ

("Petra" because it's the name of the avatar I was using this on at the time.)
